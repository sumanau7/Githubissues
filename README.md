<h2>GITHUB Issue API</h2>


This repo contains the code for a RESTful API Github Issues App that was built to display info for open issues for a repo:

<ul>
<li>express<li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

Here is the 5-part YouTube tutorial for this MEAN stack app:

<h4><a href="https://github.com/sumanau7/Githubissues">Part 1/5: - Total number of open issues</a></h4>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/sumanau7/Githubissues">Part 2/5: Number of open issues that were opened in the last 24 hours</a></h4>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/sumanau7/Githubissues">Part 3/5: Number of open issues that were opened more than 24 hours ago but less than 7 days ago</a></h4>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/sumanau7/Githubissues">Part 4/5: Number of open issues that were opened more than 7 days ago</a></h4>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/sumanau7/Githubissues">Part 5/5: Deployment on heroku</a></h4>

<h3>Instructions</h3>


    git clone git@github.com:michaelcheng429/meanstacktutorial.git

then install the Node modules with

    npm install

and then run the code with

    node web.js
<h3>Have fun!</h3>

Given more time we can use server to save repo info for faster access, we can also add a cache layer to reduce the total number of duplicate API requests.
